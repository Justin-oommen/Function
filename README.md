# **Function**

The goal is to implement an inheritance hierarchy for polymorphic classes *** Constant, Exponential, Polynomial *** based on the class Function.

    - Implement the methods value(), derivative(), integrate()
    - Overload the << operator for all classes
    - Write a program to test our code. For example we can plot our function in a histogram with ROOT
